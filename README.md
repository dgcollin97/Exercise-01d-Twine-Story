# Exercise-01d-Twine-Story
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 3 September 2020

This exercise is should be the final step in creating a minimum-requirement solution for Project 01. You task is to create a story in Twine, export it as a JSON file, and make sure it works with our Python game engine.

As usual, the first step is to Fork the repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-01d-Twine-Story

Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-F20 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Allow the browser to open (or install) GitHub Desktop. Once GitHub Desktop has loaded, you should see a window labeled "Clone a Repository" asking you for a Local Path on your computer where the project should be copied. Choose a location where you keep the repositories for this class. Make sure the Local Path ends with "Exercise-01d-Twine-Story" and then press the "Clone" button. GitHub Desktop will now download a copy of the repository to the location you indicated.

Open Visual Studio Code, and select File->Open (or Open Folder). Navigate to the repository folder you just cloned, select the folder, and press "Open".

In the far right (black) panel of the window, you should see five icons. The top one is File Explorer. If that is selected, you should see five files listed: .gitignore, game.json, LICENSE, main.py, and README.md.

Now, launch Twine and create a new project (name it whatever you want). Create a Twine project with at least eight passages. If you need more information about how to format the description or create links, you can review the [Harlowe 3.1.0 manual](https://twine2.neocities.org/#markup_link) or the [Twine 2 Guide](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide). The engine we have built will remove style markup, and it understands the `[[text->passage]]` or the `[[text|passage]]` link format.

After you have tested your project in Twine and are happy with the result, tap on the name of the project (at the bottom of the window) to open the menu. Change the Story Format to Twison 0.0.1 (if it is not installed, see the instructions in Exercise-01c-Export-from-Twine). Press the Play button, and then copy all the JSON-formatted text that appears in the browser.

Back in Visual Studio Code, open game.json and replace the contents of that file with the JSON from your new Twine project. Save the file.

Open main.py and run the game. Does it work as you would expect? 

Save these files and quit Visual Studio Code. In GitHub Desktop, you should now see main.py and game.json highlighted. Add a Summary message at the bottom of that panel, and push the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see that your files have been changed (with a new date).

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-01d-Twine-Story) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
